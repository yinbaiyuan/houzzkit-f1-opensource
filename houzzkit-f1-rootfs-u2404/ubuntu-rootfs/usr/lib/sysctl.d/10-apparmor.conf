# AppArmor restrictions of unprivileged user namespaces

# Allows to restrict the use of unprivileged user namespaces to applications
# which have an AppArmor profile loaded which specifies the userns
# permission. All other applications (whether confined by AppArmor or not) will
# be denied the use of unprivileged user namespaces.
#
# See
# https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/unprivileged_userns_restriction
#
# If it is desired to disable this restriction, it is preferable to create an
# additional file named /etc/sysctl.d/20-apparmor.conf which will override this
# current file and sets this value to 0 rather than editing this current file

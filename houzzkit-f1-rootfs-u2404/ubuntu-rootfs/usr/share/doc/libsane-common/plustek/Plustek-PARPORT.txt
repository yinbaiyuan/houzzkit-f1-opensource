====================================================================

Beginning with SANE-1.0.13, there's a backend called plustek_pp.
This is for controlling Plustek parallel-port scanner and compatible
devices. For a full listing, see plustek_pp.desc.

This code formerly was available for creating the Linux kernel module
pt_drv. This is no longer be necessary. You should be able to use
the backend out of the box.

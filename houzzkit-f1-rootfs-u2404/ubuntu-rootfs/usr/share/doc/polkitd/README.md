BUGS and DEVELOPMENT
====================

Please report non-security bugs via the polkit's freedesktop.org GitLab at

 https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/polkit/polkit/issues

The other way, in case of **non**-security issues, is to contact developers via official polkit's FreeDesktop.org mailing list at

polkit-devel@lists.freedesktop.org  

SECURITY ISSUES
===============

Please report any security issues not yet known to public

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS
==================

**polkit** uses [meson build system](https://mesonbuild.com/) for configuration with *ninja* as backend and *gcc* as compiler.  
To configure and compile your copy of polkit tarball, simply follow meson build instructions in the following manner:
```
$ meson setup [[-D option]...] target_directory
$ meson compile -C target_directory
...
# meson install -C target_directory
```

List of available configuration options can be obtained with `meson configure` command.

I WANT TO CONTRIBUTE
====================
Your merge requests and patch suggestions are welcome! If you want to contribute, a merge request on this Gitlab instance is a preferred way, yet not the only one. Please consult other options with this upsteam's maintainers.

Should you already have a freedesktop.org Gitlab account, please file your merge request. In this case, please **don't force-push any further changes** into the merge request and add a new commit into the MR instead.

Please note that there are restrictions in effect on FreeDesktop.org's instance of Gitlab, therefore new users need to take action before contributing directly via their own fork:

Thank you in advance.

* Save caller info so that protocol errors give useful tracebacks (use
  Carp::longmess?)

* Use (Self|Auto)Loader to reduce startup time; would require major
  restructuring

* Documentation needs more examples, better explanations. Borrow text
  from official protocol spec?

* Real test suite

Porting:
	64-bit architectures?
	avoid '/' as path separator; use File::something?

Extensions:
	Traditional:
	MIT-SCREEN-SAVER
	MIT-SHM
	MIT-SUNDRY-NONSTANDARD
	DOUBLE-BUFFER
	Multi-Buffering
	SYNC
	XTEST

	XFree86:	
	XFree86-Bigfont
        XFree86-DGA
        XFree86-DRI
        XFree86-VidModeExtension

	Other small:
	Extended-Visual-Information
	FontCache
	RECORD
	SECURITY
	TOG-CUP
	XC-APPGROUP

	Larger projects:
	Display Postscript?
	GLX / SGI-GLX (OpenGL)
	LBX
        X3D-PEX
	XInputExtension
	XKEYBOARD
	XVideo

Authentication protocols:
	XDM-something
	SUN-DES-1
	MIT-KERBEROS-5

Other modules:
	X11::Xlib -- XS to libX11.a
		Ken Fox has done this as part of X11-Motif, calling it
		X11::Lib.
	X11::Display, X11::Window, X11::GC, etc -- more OO, more
		intuitive interace, could be on top of Xlib
		(was in progress, now abandoned)

Long-term goals:
	Widget library
	Perl window manager:
		See PerlWM, http://www.miranda.org/~jkominek/perlwm/
		also perlwm, http://perlwm.sourceforge.net/

If you have something you think should go on this list, or if you want
to work on one or more of the above, I'd be happy to hear from you at
<SMCCAM@cpan.org>.

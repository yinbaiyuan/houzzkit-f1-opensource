Comment: This was originally copied in 2007 from Mozilla's
 nsProxyAutoConfig.js (perhaps from Firefox 1.0).
 That version was triple-licensed and explicitly allowed
 it to be relicensed to be used only under the LGPL-2.1+.
 .
 It appears like that was done because of this comment:
 "The following Javascript code was taken from Mozilla
 (http://www.mozilla.org) and is licensed according to
 the LGPLv2.1+."
 .
 For completeness, the NPL-1.1+ license is included in case the
 file is still triple-licensed.
 .
 Finally, the latest Mozilla version of this file is named
 ascii_pac_utils.js and is licensed under the MPL-2.0.

 .
     I. Effect.
 .
        These additional terms described in this Netscape Public
        License -- Amendments shall apply to the Mozilla Communicator
        client code and to all Covered Code under this License.
 .
    II. ''Netscape's Branded Code'' means Covered Code that Netscape
        distributes and/or permits others to distribute under one or
        more trademark(s) which are controlled by Netscape but which
        are not licensed for use under this License.
 .
   III. Netscape and logo.
 .
        This License does not grant any rights to use the trademarks
        "Netscape'', the "Netscape N and horizon'' logo or the
        "Netscape lighthouse" logo, "Netcenter", "Gecko", "Java" or
        "JavaScript", "Smart Browsing" even if such marks are included
        in the Original Code or Modifications.
 .
    IV. Inability to Comply Due to Contractual Obligation.
 .
        Prior to licensing the Original Code under this License,
        Netscape has licensed third party code for use in Netscape's
        Branded Code. To the extent that Netscape is limited
        contractually from making such third party code available under
        this License, Netscape may choose to reintegrate such code into
        Covered Code without being required to distribute such code in
        Source Code form, even if such code would otherwise be
        considered ''Modifications'' under this License.
 .
     V. Use of Modifications and Covered Code by Initial Developer.
 .
         V.1. In General.
 .
              The obligations of Section 3 apply to Netscape, except to
              the extent specified in this Amendment, Section V.2 and
              V.3.
 .
         V.2. Other Products.
 .
              Netscape may include Covered Code in products other than
              the Netscape's Branded Code which are released by
              Netscape during the two (2) years following the release
              date of the Original Code, without such additional
              products becoming subject to the terms of this License,
              and may license such additional products on different
              terms from those contained in this License.
 .
         V.3. Alternative Licensing.
 .
              Netscape may license the Source Code of Netscape's
              Branded Code, including Modifications incorporated
              therein, without such Netscape Branded Code becoming
              subject to the terms of this License, and may license
              such Netscape Branded Code on different terms from those
              contained in this License.
 .
    VI. Litigation.
 .
        Notwithstanding the limitations of Section 11 above, the
        provisions regarding litigation in Section 11(a), (b) and (c)
        of the License shall apply to all disputes relating to this
        License.

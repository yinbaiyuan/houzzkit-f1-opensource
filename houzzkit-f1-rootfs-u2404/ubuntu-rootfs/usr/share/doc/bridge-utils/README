This utility is DEPRECATED. No new features will ever be added.
Instead use the bridge command from the iproute2 package which
supports more features.

The code repository is:
    git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/shemminger/bridge-utils.git

The code supports:
- Multiple bridge port groups (i.e. multiple independent
  bridges in one machine).
- Each bridge is seen as a logical device, which allows you to do
  firewalling between port groups for example.
- Everything is dynamic; bridges are created dynamically using the
  userspace configuration tool, ports are added dynamically, etc.

If you have any comments, questions or suggestions, please send email to
the mailing list netdev@vger.kernel.org

 The Artistic License
 .
 Preamble
 .
 The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
 Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
 semblance of artistic control over the development of the package, while
 giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package
 in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable
 modifications.
 .
 Definitions:
 .
     "Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the
 Copyright Holder, and derivatives of that collection of files created
 through textual modification.  "Standard Version" refers to such a Package
 if it has not been modified, or has been modified in accordance with the
 wishes of the Copyright Holder.  "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in
 the copyright or copyrights for the package.  "You" is you, if you're
 thinking about copying or distributing this Package.  "Reasonable copying
 fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication
 charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to
 justify it to the Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at
 large as a market that must bear the fee.) "Freely Available" means that no
 fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees involved in
 handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may
 redistribute it under the same conditions they received it.
 .
 1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the
 Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided that you
 duplicate all of the original copyright notices and associated disclaimers.
 .
 2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications
 derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
 modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.
 .
 3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided
 that you insert a prominent notice in each changed file stating how and
 when you changed that file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the
 following:
 .
     a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them
 Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet or an
 equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive site
 such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your
 modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.
 .
     b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or
 organization.
 .
     c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
 with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide a
 separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly
 documents how it differs from the Standard Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
 executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:
 .
     a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files,
 together with instructions (in the manual page or equivalent) on where to
 get the Standard Version.
 .
     b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the
 Package with your modifications.
 .
     c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
 Standard Version executables, giving the non-standard executables
 non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages
 (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard
 Version.
 .
     d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
 .
 5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this
 Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this Package. You
 may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you may distribute
 this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part
 of a larger (possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you
 do not advertise this Package as a product of your own.
 .
 6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output
 from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall under the
 copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated them, and may
 be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
 .
 7. C or perl subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall
 not be considered part of this Package.
 .
 8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote
 products derived from this software without specific prior written
 permission.
 .
 9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
 WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
 MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

1.) usbfs: interface 1 claimed by usblp while ‘scanimage’ sets config #1

If you get this error meessage you can try

    echo -e "\nblacklist usblp" >>  /etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf

and reboot. After that your scanner can used.

REMARK: Sometimes usblp is used to access your printer.


2.) ACL: device file system does not support ACLs

From https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=789593

The file /etc/udev/rules.d/99-libsane1.rules uses the command "/bin/setfacl -m g:scanner:rw
$env{DEVNAME}" to add the "scanner" group with rw access to the device permissions.

In my case, with /dev on an ext4 filesystem with no ACL support enabled in the kernel, setfacl
returns "Operation not supported". I assume this is because it's trying to add a group, which is not
possible in its fallback mode of traditional Unix-style file permissions.

As a workaround, I have substituted "/bin/chown root:scanner $env{DEVNAME}" as the command at the
end of 99-libsane1.rules (an alternative would be to use a UDEV rule element to change the ownership).


3.) TLP and sane-backends

From https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=954096

If the scanner frontends works only once you can add your scanner into
the blacklist in /etc/default/tlp. For more Infos please read the bugreport.

Package: cloud-init
Description-md5: d4ea791a4ab9dd98376dbd623e6f7fde
Description-en: initialization and customization tool for cloud instances
 Cloud-init is the industry standard multi-distribution method for
 cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across all major
 public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud infrastructure,
 and bare-metal installations.
 .
 Cloud instances are initialized from a disk image and instance data:
 .
  * Cloud metadata
  * User data (optional)
  * Vendor data (optional)
 .
 Cloud-init will identify the cloud it is running on during boot, read any
 provided metadata from the cloud and initialize the system accordingly. This
 may involve setting up the network and storage devices to configuring SSH
 access key and many other aspects of a system. Later on the cloud-init will
 also parse and process any optional user or vendor data that was passed to
 the instance.

Description-md5: dcb442c6f30672e4b3a86ff7e3907584
Description-en: async fingerprint library of fprint project, gir bindings
 The fprint project aims to support for consumer fingerprint reader devices.
 .
 Previously, Linux support for such devices has been scattered amongst different
 projects (many incomplete) and inconsistent in that application developers
 would have to implement support for each type of fingerprint reader separately.
 The idea is to change that by providing a central system to support all the
 fingerprint readers as it's possible to get hands on.
 .
 libfprint is the centre of efforts, this component does the dirty job of
 talking to fingerprint reading devices, and processing fingerprint data.

 This library depends on the new libusb, which performs asynchronous callbacks,
 allowing fprint to perform non-blocking device tasks.

Description-en: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (Xen version)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.

 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.

Description-md5: 51e34ff8f458d3a2619abc37a6ff775b
Description-en: GRand Unified Bootloader, version 2 (ARM U-Boot version)
 GRUB is a portable, powerful bootloader.  This version of GRUB is based on a
 cleaner design than its predecessors, and provides the following new features:
 .
  - Scripting in grub.cfg using BASH-like syntax.
  - Support for modern partition maps such as GPT.
  - Modular generation of grub.cfg via update-grub.  Packages providing GRUB
    add-ons can plug in their own script rules and trigger updates by invoking
    update-grub.
 .
 This is a dependency package for a version of GRUB that has been built for
 use with ARM systems with U-Boot.  Installing this package indicates that
 this version of GRUB should be the active boot loader.

 This package contains GRUB modules that have been built for use with ARM
 systems with U-Boot.  It can be installed in parallel with other flavours,
 but will not automatically install GRUB as the active boot loader nor
 automatically update grub.cfg on upgrade unless grub-uboot is also
 installed.

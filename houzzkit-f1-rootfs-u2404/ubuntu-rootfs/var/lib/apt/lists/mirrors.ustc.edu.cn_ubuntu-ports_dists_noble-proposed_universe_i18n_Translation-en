Description-en: OpenStack Load Balancer Service - Amphora agent
 Openstack Load Balancer as a Service, codenamed Octavia was borne
 out of the Neutron LBaaS project. Its conception influenced
 the transformation of the Neutron LBaaS project, as Neutron LBaaS
 moved from version 1 to version 2. Starting with the Liberty
 release of OpenStack, Octavia has become the reference implementation
 for Neutron LBaaS version 2.
 .
 Octavia accomplishes its delivery of load balancing services by
 managing a fleet of virtual machines, containers, or bare metal
 servers—collectively known as amphorae— which it spins up on demand.
 This on-demand, horizontal scaling feature differentiates Octavia from
 other load balancing solutions, thereby making Octavia truly
 suited “for the cloud.”.
 .
 This package provides Octavia Amphora Agent.

Package: finalcif
Description-md5: 2bbc19ff75ee3b10b69f05b8f987c846
Description-en: editor for Crystallographic Information Format
 Finalcif is a full-featured CIF file editor to make editing and validation of
 CIF files easy. It collects all the information from a work folder needed in
 order to finalize a CIF file for publication. In any case, one can also import
 a valid CIF file to complete the information. In ideal cases, it takes one
 click to have a publication-ready file.
 .
 Essentially, one should have the corresponding CIF file for FinalCif in its
 original 'work' folder, which contains all other files such as SAINT list
 files, SADABS list file, SHELX list files, etc. that led to this CIF file.
 .
 Checking the final CIF file with the IUCr CheckCIF server is a one-click
 problem in FinalCif. One gets a web and PDF report or just a local PLATON CIF
 check for computers without internet.
 .
 FinalCif generates beautiful CIF reports in seconds for publication as MS Word
 files (also compatible with Openoffice etc.). The report includes tables of
 structure properties like R-values or atom parameters and a report text about
 the experiment conditions.
 .
 The button "save cif file" saves the current file under 'name'-finalcif.cif.
 FinalCif will never make changes to the original CIF file.

 for integration of custom data processing, auditing or quality
 assurance code. It is kept small to ease code audits and does
 not attempt to duplicate features, stable and trusted high quality
 encryption, networking or storage solutions already provide. So
 for example it can be integrated with your choice of trusted transports
 (ssh, SSL, xmpp, etc.) to transfer backups to other nodes according
 to predefined or custom transfer policies. GuerillaBackup ensures
 security by encrypting data at source and only this key can be
 used to decrypt the data.
 .
 WARNING: If you are familiar with GDPR, ITIL-service-strategy/design
 ISO-27k, ... this software will allow you to create custom solutions
 fulfilling your needs for high quality, legally sound backup and
 archiving data flows. If you do NOT run production with those

Description-en: Tests for async fingerprint library of fprint project
 The fprint project aims to support for consumer fingerprint reader devices.
 .
 Previously, Linux support for such devices has been scattered amongst different
 projects (many incomplete) and inconsistent in that application developers
 would have to implement support for each type of fingerprint reader separately.
 The idea is to change that by providing a central system to support all the
 fingerprint readers as it's possible to get hands on.
 .
 libfprint is the centre of efforts, this component does the dirty job of
 talking to fingerprint reading devices, and processing fingerprint data.

Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies, documentation
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 This package contains all documentation (extensive).

Description-en: OpenStack Neutron Dynamic Routing - Agent
 Neutron provides an API to dynamically request and configure virtual networks.
 These networks connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (such as
 vNICs from Nova VMs). The Neutron API supports extensions to provide advanced
 network capabilities, including QoS, ACLs, and network monitoring.
 .
 Neutron dynamic routing enables advertisement of self-service (private)
 network prefixes to physical network devices that support dynamic routing
 protocols such as routers, thus removing the conventional dependency on static
 routes.
 .
 It advertises three classes of routes:
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on non-DVR routers, the
    nexthop is the centralized router.
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on DVR routers, the nexthop is
    the appropriate compute node.
  * Prefix routes for directly routable tenant networks with address scopes,
    the nexthop is the centralized router, the same for DVR and CVR.
 .
 Neutron dynamic routing consists of service plug-in and agent. The service
 plug-in implements the Networking service extension and the agent manages
 dynamic routing protocol peering sessions. The plug-in communicates with the
 agent through RPC.
 .
 This package contains the Dynamic Routing agent.

Description-md5: e7fdf1d9a521f5b2c24b5f7b01c8cfce
Description-en: OpenStack Neutron Dynamic Routing - Python 3 library
 Neutron provides an API to dynamically request and configure virtual networks.
 These networks connect "interfaces" from other OpenStack services (such as
 vNICs from Nova VMs). The Neutron API supports extensions to provide advanced
 network capabilities, including QoS, ACLs, and network monitoring.
 .
 Neutron dynamic routing enables advertisement of self-service (private)
 network prefixes to physical network devices that support dynamic routing
 protocols such as routers, thus removing the conventional dependency on static
 routes.
 .
 It advertises three classes of routes:
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on non-DVR routers, the
    nexthop is the centralized router.
  * Host routes for floating IP addresses hosted on DVR routers, the nexthop is
    the appropriate compute node.
  * Prefix routes for directly routable tenant networks with address scopes,
    the nexthop is the centralized router, the same for DVR and CVR.
 .
 Neutron dynamic routing consists of service plug-in and agent. The service
 plug-in implements the Networking service extension and the agent manages
 dynamic routing protocol peering sessions. The plug-in communicates with the
 agent through RPC.
 .
 This package provides the Python 3 library.

Package: xnest
Description-md5: 8fb9e95ed5f9c018992a8cdc83935474
Description-en: Nested X server
 Xnest is a nested X server that simply relays all its requests to another
 X server, where it runs as a client.  This means that it appears as another
 window in your current X session.  Xnest relies upon its parent X server
 for font services.
 .
 Use of the Xephyr X server instead of Xnest is recommended.
 .

 This package provides original Debian (with Debian patches already
 applied, and autotools files updated) sources for the X.Org ('Xorg')
 X server shipped in a tarball.  This enables other projects re-using
 X server codebase (e.g. VNC servers) to (re-)use officially
 Debian-supported version of the X xserver for their builds.
 .
 Unless you are building a software product using X server sources,
 you probably want xserver-xorg and/or xserver-xorg-core instead.

Package: xvfb
Description-md5: 1cd5b85acd06c23d376b7b5a7f30a0b8
Description-en: Virtual Framebuffer 'fake' X server
 Xvfb provides an X server that can run on machines with no display hardware
 and no physical input devices. It emulates a dumb framebuffer using virtual
 memory. The primary use of this server was intended to be server testing,
 but other novel uses for it have been found, including testing clients
 against unusual depths and screen configurations, doing batch processing with
 Xvfb as a background rendering engine, load testing, as an aid to porting the
 X server to a new platform, and providing an unobtrusive way to run
 applications that don't really need an X server but insist on having one
 anyway.
 .
 This package also contains a convenience script called xvfb-run which
 simplifies the automated execution of X clients in a virtual server
 environment. This convenience script requires the use of the xauth
 program.
 .

Description-md5: 7727e410aa3baa784cb47a4afb95f4e8
Description-en: Modular compiler and toolchain technologies, OCaml bindings
 LLVM is a collection of libraries and tools that make it easy to build
 compilers, optimizers, just-in-time code generators, and many other
 compiler-related programs.
 .
 LLVM uses a single, language-independent virtual instruction set both
 as an offline code representation (to communicate code between
 compiler phases and to run-time systems) and as the compiler internal
 representation (to analyze and transform programs). This persistent
 code representation allows a common set of sophisticated compiler
 techniques to be applied at compile-time, link-time, install-time,
 run-time, or "idle-time" (between program runs).
 .
 This package provides the OCaml bindings to develop applications using llvm.

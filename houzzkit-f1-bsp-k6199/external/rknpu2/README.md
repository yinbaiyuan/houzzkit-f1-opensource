        <img src="res/framework.png" title="RKNN"/>
    </center>

  In order to use RKNPU, users need to first run the RKNN-Toolkit2 tool on the computer, convert the trained model into an RKNN format model, and then inference on the development board using the RKNN C API or Python API.

- RKNN-Toolkit2 is a software development kit for users to perform model conversion, inference and performance evaluation on PC and Rockchip NPU platforms.

- RKNN-Toolkit-Lite2 provides Python programming interfaces for Rockchip NPU platform to help users deploy RKNN models and accelerate the implementation of AI applications.

- RKNN Runtime provides C/C++ programming interfaces for Rockchip NPU platform to help users deploy RKNN models and accelerate the implementation of AI applications.

- RKNPU kernel driver is responsible for interacting with NPU hardware. It has been open source and can be found in the Rockchip kernel code.

  - Ubuntu 22.04 python 3.10/3.11
- Latest version:1.6.0(Release version)

# CHANGELOG

## 1.6.0
 - Support ONNX model of OPSET 12~19
 - Support custom operators (including CPU and GPU)
 - Optimization operators support such as dynamic weighted convolution, Layernorm, RoiAlign, Softmax, ReduceL2, Gelu, GLU, etc.
 - Added support for python3.7/3.9/3.11
 - Add rknn_convert function
 - Optimize transformer support
 - Optimize the MatMul API, such as increasing the K limit length, RK3588 adding int4 * int4 -> int16 support, etc.
 - Optimize RV1106 rknn_init initialization time, memory consumption, etc.
 - RV1106 adds int16 support for some operators
 - Fixed the problem that the convolution operator of RV1106 platform may make random errors in some cases.
 - Optimize user manual
 - Reconstruct the rknn model zoo and add support for multiple models such as detection, segmentation, OCR, and license plate recognition.

 for older version, please refer [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md)
